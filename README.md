# libCellAut
This is a simple cellular automata library that can be used as a template. Simply override some methods and bend it to your liking!
 
Included experiments:
* forest.py - A forest-growing simulation inspired by a cellular automaton found in the main menu of the game [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com/).
* fractal.py - A neat little fractalish thing
* gameoflife.py - Conway's Game of Life
* screensaver.py - A neat, evolving fractalish screensaver. (Use a very large window!)
