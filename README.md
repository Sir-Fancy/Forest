# libCellAut
This is a simple cellular automata library that can be used as a template. Simply override some methods and bend it to your liking!
 
Included experiments:
* elementary.py - A simulation of 1-D [Elementary Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), rule number required as argument, with optional "--random" to randomize inital state
* forest.py - A forest-growing simulation inspired by a cellular automaton found in the main menu of the game [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com/).
* fractal.py - A neat little fractalish thing
* gameoflife.py - Conway's Game of Life (B2/S23)
* highlife.py - Highlife cellular automaton similar to Conway's. (B36/S23)
* matrix.py - The stereotypical matrix-esque visual associated with terminals.
* screensaver.py - A neat, evolving fractalish screensaver. (Use a very large window!)
